ros-melodic-semantic-point-annotator (0.1.18-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * catkinize packages
  * Add ignores.
  * Removing some launch files that we don't need anymore
  * Porting the ground removal stuff away from PointCloud to PointCloud2. Still needs testing though.
  * Remove deprecated API usage
  * eigen updates
  * port to eigen3 and remove deprecated use of message size
  * Unreal, the code actually depended on reading the parameters every cycle to work because it reset the value of z_threshold_ which got transformed to a different frame every cycle
  * Removing reading of parameters from the cloud callback
  * Changing in all three files instead of just one for empty cloud... this package is a mess... really should switch to new pcl stufff
  * Empty clouds are sometimes expected and should be passed on... not errored on and dropped
  * Copying pr2_navigation from staging area to stacks section of the repoistory
